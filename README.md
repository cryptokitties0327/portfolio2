# Personal Portfolio
# Preface
This portfolio website is the first HTML & CSS project done for the Coder Academy Fast Track Bootcamp. I had a lot of fun when I tried building the website.

My goal is to continue working my portfolio long term and showcase my progress to everyone.

## Planning
From the beginning, what I really focused first was the colors. I wanted to have a design that is simple and clean.

## Design
### Wireframe & Scheme
I have done all my planning on Figma.

Initially, my design was based on a big photo.
